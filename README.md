Use

**Note: CLAVIN, and by extension CLIFF, is very memory hungry due to the
geonames index. To properly run, a minimum of 4GB of RAM is necessary. Any less
and you'll experience errors.**

Build using

```
docker build -t cliff:2.3.0 .
```

It is setup to use the default port of `8080`. Run using

```
docker run -p "8080:8080" -d cliff:2.3.0
```

The API endpoint for CLIFF is `/CLIFF-2.3.0/parse/text`
